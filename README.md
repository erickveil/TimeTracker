# TimeTrack

A utility used to track the passage of time in D&D games.

Rather than have sheets of checkboxes to tick off as time passes in my games,
I will just run this application and click off the buttons.

Since in my game, the world doesn't track exact time, and just a general 
"daytime", "noon", "evening", etc, the tracker provides those names to go with
the more exact time that I use as a DM. The names used match those used in the
Forgotten Realms, and they adjust depending on the time of year (winter days
grow shorter and summer days grow longer). So when a PC asks, "What time is 
it?" I give them this more general name rather than an exact time.

At the end of a session, I just note where we left off, and before the next 
session begins, I set the time in the app after I start it up.
